# Project DORI: Drones for Operational Rescue and Intervention, Unity Demonstrator
DORI is a student project aimed at developing a system coordinating a swarm of drones to aid firefighters in rescue operations in enclosed environments. This project scope fits especially well in events such as natural disasters and war destructions.

The demonstrator for this project is developed using Unity Simulation.

To install this package, 

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
### Unity version 2021 or higher
Input Manager package (can be installed using the Unity Package Manager)
Components
The current components of the project are:
=======
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

### Simulation of Thermal Camera
This component simulates the functionality of a thermal camera to aid in locating heat signatures.

### Simple Drone Simulation
This component simulates the movement and control of a single drone.
Provides GoTo function.

### Connection Simulation between Drones
This script simulates the connection and communication between multiple drones within a building.

### Usage
To use the project, simply open the Unity project and run the scene that corresponds to the component you wish to test. The Input Manager package should already be installed, but if not, it can be installed using the Unity Package Manager.

### Future Work
Future components to be added to the project include:

Mapping and navigation system for drones ( SLAM )
Improved AI and pathfinding algorithms for the drone swarm
